# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
This project is created to analysis credit card approval of a bank using Classification Machine Learning Model
• I have	developed and trained a classification machine learning model using Logistic Regressor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes algorithms achieving an average accuracy of 75%.
•	Implemented the model into a Flask API to provide real-time predictions and streamline data analysis process for stakeholders.
•	Optimized the model's performance resulting in an increase in accuracy by 10% through feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold Cross Validation.
